# PRESCRIPTO-Doctor Appointment Booking System

Prescripto is a patient-friendly website designed to streamline the process of scheduling doctor appointments. This platform allows patients to easily book appointments, view their medical history, and receive reminders for follow-up visits or medication refills, all from a single, convenient dashboard.

This full stack appointment booking system can be used by a doctor or a hospital. Because in this project we have created 3 level of authentication. 1st one is for Patients, so that patient can login on the website, book appointment with doctor and manage the booked appointment. 2nd one is doctor login, so that doctor can login and check the appointment and their earning. Doctor can update their profile also from dashboard. 3rd one is Admin Dashboard where admin can manages the appointment and admin can also manage the doctor profile.
